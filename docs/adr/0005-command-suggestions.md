# ADR 0005: Command Suggestions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The CLI tool needs to provide intelligent command suggestions when users ask about tools for specific tasks. We need to design a system that can:
- Understand user queries about command-line tools
- Match queries to appropriate tools
- Provide relevant suggestions with examples
- Present information in a user-friendly way

## Decision
1. Create a dedicated commands module with:
   - Static command database
   - Pattern matching engine
   - Suggestion scoring system
   - Formatted output generator

2. Command Database Design:
   - Store comprehensive tool information
   - Include categories and keywords
   - Maintain usage examples
   - Support multiple tools per task

3. Pattern Matching Strategy:
   - Use regex for pattern matching
   - Extract key terms and intents
   - Support fuzzy matching
   - Consider task categories

4. Output Format:
   - Use colored output for tool names
   - Include brief descriptions
   - Show example usage
   - List alternative tools

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clean separation of command suggestion logic
- Easy to add new commands and patterns
- Consistent output format
- Extensible matching system
- Good user experience with colored output

### Negative
- Static database requires manual updates
- Pattern matching may need ongoing refinement
- Limited to known commands
- May need platform-specific handling
- Memory usage for command database

## Implementation Notes
- Use lazy_static for efficient database loading
- Implement scoring system for relevance
- Support multiple suggestion styles
- Handle platform differences
- Include common command variations

## Alternatives Considered
1. Dynamic command discovery
   - Rejected due to security concerns
2. Online command database
   - Rejected for offline support
3. Machine learning approach
   - Deferred for future enhancement
4. Shell integration
   - Rejected for portability
