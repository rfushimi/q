# Milestone 6 Implementation Notes

## What Went Well
1. Successfully implemented streaming and resilience features:
   - Token-by-token streaming
   - Exponential backoff retry logic
   - Query response caching
   - Progress indicators
2. Created a clean core module structure
3. Added proper error handling
4. Added comprehensive test coverage
5. Maintained clean separation of concerns

## What Could Be Improved
1. Several unused fields and methods (marked by compiler warnings)
2. Could add persistent caching
3. Could improve retry policies
4. Could add more progress indicator styles
5. Could optimize streaming performance

## Next Steps
1. Add persistent cache storage
2. Implement custom retry policies
3. Add more progress indicators
4. Add cache sharing between sessions
5. Optimize streaming performance

## Technical Debt
1. Unused code should be either utilized or removed
2. Some error handling could be more specific
3. Test coverage could be expanded
4. Documentation could be more detailed

## Security Considerations
1. Safe cache size limits
2. Secure retry logic
3. Safe stream handling
4. Memory usage monitoring
5. Error handling security

## Testing Notes
1. Unit tests cover core functionality
2. Integration tests verify resilience
3. Edge cases are handled
4. Cache operations are verified
5. Retry logic is tested
