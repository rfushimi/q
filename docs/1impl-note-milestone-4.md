# Milestone 4 Implementation Notes

## What Went Well
1. Successfully implemented context injection with three providers:
   - Shell history (@hist)
   - Directory listing (@here)
   - File content (@file)
2. Created a clean trait-based abstraction for context providers
3. Added proper error handling for context-related operations
4. Implemented size limits and validation
5. Added comprehensive test coverage
6. Maintained clean separation of concerns

## What Could Be Improved
1. Several unused fields and methods (marked by compiler warnings)
2. Could add caching for frequently accessed contexts
3. Could optimize context size by better formatting
4. Could add more context providers (e.g., git status)
5. Could add support for multiple file contexts

## Next Steps
1. Implement context caching
2. Add more context providers
3. Add context size optimization
4. Improve error messages
5. Add support for combining multiple contexts more efficiently

## Technical Debt
1. Unused code should be either utilized or removed
2. Some error handling could be more specific
3. Test coverage could be expanded
4. Documentation could be more detailed

## Security Considerations
1. File paths are properly validated
2. Size limits prevent excessive memory usage
3. Hidden files are handled securely
4. Permissions are properly checked
5. Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Testing Notes
1. Unit tests cover core functionality
2. Integration tests verify context gathering
3. Edge cases are handled (permissions, size limits)
4. Mock file system used for testing
5. Temporary files cleaned up properly
