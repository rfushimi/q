# Milestone 3 Implementation Notes

## What Went Well
1. Successfully implemented the OpenAI API integration
2. Added proper error handling and API key validation
3. Implemented both streaming and non-streaming query support
4. Added comprehensive test coverage
5. Maintained clean separation of concerns with the API module
6. Secured API key handling using external files

## What Could Be Improved
1. Several unused methods and fields (marked by compiler warnings)
2. Streaming implementation could be more efficient
3. Error messages could be more user-friendly
4. Could add more comprehensive integration tests
5. Could add retry logic for transient failures

## Next Steps
1. Implement streaming query usage in CLI
2. Add Gemini API support
3. Add retry logic with backoff
4. Add response caching
5. Improve error messages and user feedback

## Technical Debt
1. Unused code should be either utilized or removed
2. Some error handling could be more specific
3. Test coverage could be expanded
4. Documentation could be more detailed

## Security Considerations
1. API keys are stored in separate files
2. Keys are validated before use
3. Error messages don't expose sensitive information
4. Files with keys are properly gitignored
